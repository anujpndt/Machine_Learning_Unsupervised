# Machine_Learning_Unsupervised
# Project 1 :- Customer Segmentation Using K-means 
I used K-means, a machine learning technique, to group customers based on similar behaviors and preferences. This helps businesses tailor their strategies and services to different customer segments, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and business efficiency.
# Project 2 :- Forecasting Data using Holt's winter Exponential
I used Holt's Winter Exponential algorithm in machine learning to forecast data. By applying this technique, I accurately predicted future trends and patterns in the data, enabling informed decision-making and better planning for the future
# Project 3 :- Principal Component Analysis(House Price)
I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in a machine learning algorithm to predict house prices. PCA helped reduce data dimensions while preserving relevant features, enhancing the model's accuracy in forecasting house prices.
# Project 4 :- Time Series Modelling(Sales of Furniture)
I applied time series modeling to predict furniture sales using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing past sales data, I used algorithms like ARIMA or Prophet to forecast future sales trends. This enabled better inventory management and informed decision-making for optimizing furniture sales and meeting customer demand effectively.
# Project 5 :-
I applied Hierarchical Clustering, a machine learning algorithm, to group travel reviews based on similarity. By analyzing the text content and clustering reviews, I identified patterns and categories within the data, assisting in organizing and understanding diverse travel experiences for potential insights and decision-making in the travel industry.
