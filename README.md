# Project 1 :- Customer Segmentation Using K-means 
I used K-means, a machine learning technique, to group customers based on similar behaviors and preferences. This helps businesses tailor their strategies and services to different customer segments, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and business efficiency.
# Project 2 :- 
I used Holt's Winter Exponential algorithm in machine learning to forecast data. By applying this technique, I accurately predicted future trends and patterns in the data, enabling informed decision-making and better planning for the future
